# Industrial-Robotics
Industrial Robotics Course (ES827) Project

## üìã Description

The project consists of developing the IRB 120 robot model and implementing a program for the robot to draw an ellipse on the floor of the workspace and an ellipse on one of the walls, as in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=440-3LCZ_ow).

This project carried out:
- Schematic of the manipulator;
- Calculate the Denavit‚ÄìHartenberg (DH) parameters and develop the direct kinematics;
- Calculate the Jacobian;
- Compare the values of the direct kinematics with the inverse one for the same position;
- Elaborate the path to draw an ellipse;
- Calculate the torque (RNE function in Robotics System Toolbox);
- Develop the torque control, changing parameters such as kt, kp and the object's mass to be transported.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software used

This project was implemented in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html).
